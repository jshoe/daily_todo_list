# Daily todo list app

Simple Ruby on Rails app I started on to manage daily todos and learn some CSS. Uses Bootstrap SASS and dynamically resizing responsive text fields. Uses devise for user accounts.

Showing dynamically resizing datetime fields at different window resolutions:

Large window resolution with full datetime:
